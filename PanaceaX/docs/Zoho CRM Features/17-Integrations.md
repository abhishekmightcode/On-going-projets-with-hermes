## 6. User Workflow Use Cases

### Workflow A: Standard Record Lifecycle

```
1. Record Created (manual, webform, or API)
2. Assignment Rule assigns owner (if configured)
3. Workflow triggers -> Field updates, tasks created
4. User updates fields based on interaction
5. Stage/Status changed -> triggers next workflow
6. Related records linked (Contacts, Deals, etc.)
7. Approval initiated (if threshold met)
8. Record finalized -> Analytics captured
```

### Workflow B: Automated Engagement

```
1. New record enters system
2. Scoring rules evaluated -> Score calculated
3. Assignment based on score + territory
4. High-intent -> Immediate rep notification
5. Medium-intent -> Nurture sequence started
6. Low-intent -> Long-term campaign added
7. Zia analyzes pattern -> Suggests optimizations
```

### Workflow C: Multi-Stage Process

```
Stage 1: New/Incoming
  -> Auto-assign, send acknowledgment
  
Stage 2: In Progress
  -> Set reminder tasks, update fields
  
Stage 3: Pending Approval
  -> Lock record, notify approvers
  
Stage 4: Approved/Rejected
  -> Unlock, update status, trigger next steps
  
Stage 5: Completed/Closed

```

## 7. Deeper Analysis

### Edge Cases

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| Duplicate record | Duplicate check workflow + merge option |
| Concurrent edit | Last-write-wins with audit log |
| Owner left company | Reassignment rule + manager backup |
| Mass import | Batch process with validation |
| API rate limit | Exponential backoff + queue |

### Performance Considerations

- **Query Optimization:** Use indexed fields for filters
- **Bulk Operations:** Batch API for 100+ records
- **Workflow Efficiency:** Avoid synchronous webhooks in high-volume triggers
- **Caching:** Frequently accessed layouts cached at app layer

### Security Model

```
Organization
  |__ Roles (Sales Rep, Manager, Admin)
        |__ Profiles (Standard, Limited, Read-Only)
              |__ Field-Level Permissions (Visible, Editable, Hidden)
                    |__ Record-Level Access (Owner, Assigned, All)
```

### Scalability

- **Horizontal:** Multi-node deployment for high availability
- **Vertical:** Increased compute for batch processing
- **Sharding:** Data partitioned by organization (multi-tenant)
- **CDN:** Static assets served via edge network
